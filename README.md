# What is an orrery?

*An [orrery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery) is a mechanical model of the Solar System that illustrates or predicts the relative positions and motions of the planets and moons, usually according to the heliocentric model. It may also represent the relative sizes of these bodies; however, since accurate scaling is often not practical due to the actual large ratio differences, a subdued approximation may be used instead. (...) They are typically driven by a clockwork mechanism with a globe representing the Sun at the centre, and with a planet at the end of each of the arms.*

*A [tellurion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tellurion) is a clock, surmounted by a mechanism that depicts how day, night, and the seasons are caused by the rotation and orientation of Earth on its axis and its orbit around the Sun. The clock normally also displays the age of the Moon and the four-year (perpetual) calendar.*

# This project

This project is about the design and optimization of the mechanical orrery, inspired by designs from [Zeamon](http://zeamon.com/wordpress/?p=670), [Staines & Son] (https://www.orrerydesign.com/), [Induku](https://indukudesign.com/2018/02/15/orrery/) and [J. Turner](https://www.turnercreativity.com/projects/orrery/).
